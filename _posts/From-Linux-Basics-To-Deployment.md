## Install Linux
- Requests of Installation:
1. Above GPU i5
2. Above 8G of RAM
3. Above 100G of Hard Disk

- For Mac:
I suggest using **VMware Fusion** virtual machine to install Linux, it's very convinient but $30 will be paid. And you don't need to prepare another USB to boot, if you don't like this the ditribution you can simply delete the virtual machine and reinstall another distribution of Linux.

This is a short introduction of linux, and I will introduce other topics of linux in the outline.
Thank you~ and enjoy linux~
