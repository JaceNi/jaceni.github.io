## You don't have to be a ward wizard

The cool thing about copywriting is it is as much science as it is art. Great copywriters understand this and that’s what sets them apart from mediocre ones. You don’t have to be a word wizard to craft an impactful ad copy, what you need is to find a way to tap into your consumers’ internal motivators and persuade them to react to your ad.

According to [Copyblogger](https://www.copyblogger.com/copywriting-101/) 
> **“copywriting is the art and science of strategically delivering words (whether written or spoken) that get people to take some form of action.”**

Once you understand your consumer’s psychology and know their mental triggers, it becomes easier to get them to indulge to your persuasion. 

Copywriting is not about using flowery language to communicate to your consumer. It is more about writing what the consumer wants to read. It is important to adapt to their language, tonality, and perspective to get across your message.

## Why is copywriting as much science as it is art?

- Research: 

By definition, research itself is a systematic investigation and study of material and sources to establish facts and to gather information. It is an integral part of the copywriting process because it helps in understanding the consumer, markets, product, and competitors.

- Psychology: 

It is another branch of science that holds significance while writing an effective copy. While writing a good ad copy, the idea is to get into the brains of your reader and use their internal motivators to make them respond to your communication and push them to take action

- Communication:

Copywriting is not about using flowery language to communicate to your consumer. It is more about writing what the consumer wants to read. It is important to adapt to their language, tonality, and perspective to get across your message.


## How can you activate the mental triggers of your prospects?

- Focus on the benefits of the products instead of its features:

A lot of copywriters get into the trap of describing the product, what they don’t realise is what they say about the product can be said about four or five other products from the same category! A consumer tends to make a purchase decision based on what value the product promises to add to their life instead of its features, so you need to convey what the product does for the consumer.

- Give them social proof:

When you’re talking about how good your product is or seeking the trust of consumers, back up your statements with supporting proof to give yourself credibility.If it’s a long form of copy you can incorporate case studies, testimonials, and reviews to validate your claim.Shorter copy should include data/numbers from happy customers, opinion leaders and trusted icons and the likes to establish reliability and authority.

There it is — a handy guide to writing impactful copy. Use these tips to psyche out your customer and nudge them to take action.
